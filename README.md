- faithfulness
- answer_relevancy
- context_relevancy
- context_recall



#### How to improve RAG

- [ ] Data quality, data cleaning
- [ ] Text segmentation, try different segmentation strategies
- [ ] Try different vector storage methods: Faiss, Chroma, Pinecone. Experiment with different embedding methods (e.g., BGE)
- [ ] Experiment with different retrievers
- [ ] Use hybrid search methods, such as BM25+Faiss
- [ ] RAG-Fusion: Generate multiple user queries and rank the results, utilizing Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) and custom vector score weighting to achieve comprehensive and accurate results.
